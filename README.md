# Password_classification_using_ML
I have been wanting to do a few projects on Machine Learning and Cyber Security. This is another project related to infosec and machine learning.
The algorithm learnt the rules from existing algorithms but I combined the results of multiple algorithms to make it robust. It is not just imitating a rule based algorithm. It is imitating an amalgam of many password strength checking algorithms used in the wild. This is a project that I did in my spare time and is by no means a comprehensive one
